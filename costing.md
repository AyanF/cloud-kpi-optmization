### Generic factors affecting costing on AWS
The cost of hosting a software application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) can be influenced by a variety of factors. AWS offers a range of services, pricing models, and options that can impact the overall cost. Here are some of the key factors that can affect the costing of a software application hosted on AWS:

1. **Infrastructure Services**: The type and number of infrastructure services you use, such as virtual machines (EC2 instances), databases (RDS), storage (S3, EBS), and networking (VPC, ELB), can significantly impact the cost. The size and specifications of these resources, as well as their uptime and usage, will influence your expenses.

2. **Instance Types and Sizes**: AWS offers various instance types with different compute, memory, and storage capabilities. Choosing the appropriate instance type for your application's requirements can impact costs. Larger instances with more resources generally cost more than smaller ones.

3. **Storage Usage**: The amount and type of storage your application uses will affect costs. This includes block storage (EBS), object storage (S3), and database storage (RDS). Costs can increase based on the volume of data stored and the frequency of access.

4. **Data Transfer**: Data transferred in and out of AWS (both within regions and across regions) incurs charges. Heavy data transfer, especially over the internet, can contribute to costs.

5. **Geographical Region**: The AWS region you choose to host your application can influence costs. Pricing may vary slightly between regions, and some services might have different availability in different regions.

6. **Usage Patterns**: The actual usage patterns of your application, including peak times and fluctuations in demand, can affect costs. Scaling resources up and down to meet demand can impact pricing.

7. **Reserved Instances** and Savings Plans: AWS offers options to commit to using resources for a longer period, which can lead to cost savings compared to on-demand pricing. Reserved Instances and Savings Plans are cost-saving strategies that require upfront commitments.

8. **Managed Services**: Using managed services like AWS Lambda, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or AWS Fargate can affect costs. While these services can simplify operations, they come with their own pricing models.

9. **Data Processing**: Services like AWS Lambda, AWS Glue, and Amazon EMR that process and analyze data can contribute to costs. The volume and complexity of data processing can impact expenses.

10. **Third-Party Services**: Integrating third-party services, APIs, or marketplace solutions can introduce additional costs. Be aware of any licensing or usage fees associated with these services.

11. **Compliance and Security**: Depending on your application's security and compliance requirements, you might need to use specific services or configurations that can affect costs.

12. **Monitoring and Management**: Enabling monitoring, logging, and management services (like Amazon CloudWatch) can provide insights into your application's performance, but they can also contribute to costs.

13. **Support Plans**: AWS offers various support plans, each with different levels of assistance. Higher-tier support plans come with an additional cost.
